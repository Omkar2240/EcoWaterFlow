                <p>There is rising demand for water in Jamshedpur. At the same time, the city suffers water loss, which can be as much as 36%. The presence of a large number of illegal connections further reduces the efficiency of the piped water network.</p>

               <p>
                Bengaluru is experiencing a severe water crisis, the worst in its history since February 2024, affecting schools, hospitals, and households due to a shortage of 500 million litres daily. With many borewells dried up, both short-term solutions and long-term strategies are essential to address and prevent future shortages.

                <h2>Reuse of Wastewater in Nagpur, Maharashtra </h2>
                <p>
                    Nagpur, a city of about 2.5 million people, is in Maharashtra in central India. The water supply system in this city is regulated by the water works division of the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). The city is experiencing a growing water demand, with new water sources being located far away. The harnessing of these sources will require a lot of capital and energy consumption. There is already a scarcity of resources and funds to be spent after augmentation of water sources.

                    (CBSSD) Project in East Devadhanam, Trichy, Tamil Nadu </h2>
                <p>East Devadhanam is a peri-urban slum in Tiruchirapally, Tamil Nadu, which was plagued 
                    by lack of basic water and sanitation facilities. There was poor access to safe drinking water, lack of safe sanitation facilities leading to open defecation, and lack of sewage treatment facilities leading to health hazards. Clogged drains and open drains flowing into River Cauvery was causing pollution. </p>

                <p>
                    The rapid growth of urbanisation in Surat has led to an increasing demand for water, with an estimated demand of 2331 MLD till 2014. Meanwhile, the sources of surface water in the Tapti River are scarce.

                <h2>Integrated Water Management in Mulbagal, Karnataka</h2>
                <p>Mulbagal is a Class III town in the Kolar district of Karnataka, spread over 9.8 sq.km. The town population was close to 50,000 in 2008 when the project was initiated, with about 31% of the population living in slums. It lies in a region with no viable source of surface water and was totally dependent on ground water for its drinking supplies. The waste water is disposed through septic tanks since the town does not have any sewerage system. Open defecation is prevalent and the open waste flows into storm water drains, and flows into water bodies contaminating them. </p>
