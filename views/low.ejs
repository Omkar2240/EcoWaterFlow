                    <h2>1. Groundwater Recharge and Conservation</h2>
                    <p>Recharge Wells and Pits: In areas where groundwater extraction is used for agriculture or household needs, setting up rainwater recharge pits or wells can help replenish the groundwater table. These systems help absorb excess rainwater, ensuring groundwater availability in the future.
                        Vegetative Groundwater Recharge: Encouraging the preservation of forests and vegetation in watershed areas to support groundwater recharge naturally. Forests play a key role in maintaining the water cycle and preventing soil erosion.</p>

                    <h2>2.Protection of Water Sources and Watershed Management </h2>
                    <p>Conservation of Springs and Rivers: In Sikkim, several villages depend on local springs and mountain streams. Protecting these water sources by managing forest cover and controlling deforestation is crucial for maintaining a steady water supply.
                        Watershed Protection: Sikkim can implement watershed management programs to maintain healthy watersheds that capture and distribute rainwater effectively. This helps in preventing soil erosion and improving water quality in rivers and streams.</p>

                    <h2>3. Conservation of Water Bodies</h2>
                    <p>Protection of Water Bodies: Jammu and Kashmir has many lakes, rivers, and water reservoirs like Dal Lake in Srinagar. Efforts should be focused on cleaning and restoring these lakes to improve water quality and storage capacity. Regular desilting and prevention of encroachments can enhance the availability of water.
                        Floodplain Management: Given the regionâ€™s susceptibility to floods, implementing floodplain management practices to preserve natural water storage areas and ensure efficient water flow during high water periods can prevent both flooding and water scarcity in dry seasons.</p>

                    <h2>4. Rainwater-Sensitive Urban Planning</h2>
                    <p>Permeable Surfaces: In Kochi and other urban areas, promoting permeable pavements and green roofs helps reduce stormwater runoff and allows water to infiltrate into the soil, aiding groundwater recharge.
                        Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS): Implementing SuDS for better management of stormwater, ensuring that water is stored and reused instead of flowing into drains, is an effective measure for cities with moderate water stress.</p>
