                    <p class="article-summary">The increase in the demand for water is expected to tap out the water supplies as later is finite in nature.
                        The intent of this study was to analyze the degree of water scarcity using the Water Poverty Index (WPI) for the million-plus urban agglomerations of households.Indian cities are rapidly expanding and with increase in migration the country is expected to witness unprecedented urbanization in the coming decade.</p>

                    <p class="article-summary">Water scarcity metrics are used to identify water scarcity hotspots and to understand the links between water scarcity and violent conflicts.
                        Water scarcity metrics show varying levels of water scarcity across the study area with capital cities being the most affected areas.
                        High green water scarcity (soil moisture deficit) and low Falkenmark index scores (water stress) are closely linked to water conflicts</p>

                    <p class="article-summary">Water scarcity is a rapidly growing concern around the globe, but little is known about how it has developed over time. This study provides a first assessment of continuous sub-national trajectories of blue water consumption, renewable freshwater availability, and water scarcity for the entire 20th century. Water scarcity is analysed using the fundamental concepts of shortage and stress which indicate difficulties in satisfying the needs of a population and overuse of resources respectively.</p>

                    <p class="article-summary">Water scarcity has become a major constraint to socio-economic development and a threat to livelihood in increasing parts of the world. Since the late 1980s, water scarcity research has attracted much political and public attention. We here review a variety of indicators that have been developed to capture different characteristics of water scarcity. </p>

                    <p class="article-summary">With the planets second largest population at 1.3 billion, and expectant growth to 1.7 billion by 2050, India finds itself unable to serve the vast majority of that populace with safe, clean water.
                        Supporting 16% of the world’s inhabitants is daunting enough, but it is even more so when recognizing that population is crammed into an area one-third the size of the United States. Then consider that India only possesses 4% of the world’s fresh water and the crisis can be more fully realized.</p>

                    <p class="article-summary">Water scarcity is a pervasive threat to society that is expected to intensify alongside a growing and more affluent population and a changing climate. In this paper, we review the existing literature to assess the potential of lessening water scarcity by reducing food loss and waste. Existing studies reveal the scope of food loss and waste and its accompanying impact on water resources, thereby providing a foundation for policy action.</p>
